I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/).

Prior to this, I obtained my Master's degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. Tiande Guo, and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Zhengzhou University](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning** and **probabilistic inference**, with a particular focus on:

- **Diffusion-Based Sampling**: Developing efficient sampling algorithms for complex discrete and continuous distributions
- **Neural Combinatorial Optimization**: Designing learning-based solvers with emphasis on generalization and scalability
- **AI4Science**: Applying AI techniques to scientific discovery and problem-solving
- **Diffusion LLM**: Exploring diffusion models for large language model training and inference
<!-- - **Graph Neural Networks**: Studying theoretical foundations and practical applications of graph-based deep learning -->

For a complete list of my publications, please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ptf3uO0AAAAJ) profile.

<!-- ## Academic Achievements

**Publications**: 6 papers (5 as first or co-first author) in top-tier venues including **ICML**, **KDD**, and **IEEE TPAMI**

**Citations**: 137 citations with an h-index of 5 ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ptf3uO0AAAAJ)) -->
